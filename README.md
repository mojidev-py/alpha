# 🐺

🐺 is a funny project I am going to make that is basically python, but gen alpha-ized.

## EXAMPLE

```py

like woah = Capping

what if woah was Capping:
    like say "bro this is cool"
```

## OUTPUT:
```
blud is actually coolmaxxing right now
```
as you can see, it "gen-alpha"izes the output.
