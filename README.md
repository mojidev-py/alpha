# üê∫

üê∫ is a funny project I am going to make that is basically python, but gen alpha-ized.

## EXAMPLE

```py

like woah is like Capping fr

wait self is rizzing up the baddies using Capping?
    rizz up "bro this is actually cool"
üê∫awooo
```

## OUTPUT:
```
blud is actually coolmaxxing right now
```
as you can see, it "gen-alpha"izes the output.

## DOCUMENTATION

*So, I don't want to ask how you even stumbled on this, but I kinda do. If you aren't in the right mind, please contact your family or closest friends for support.*

*Anyway, let's dive into the deep end.*

*How does this language work?*
Here's a basic diagram showing the steps the interpeter takes to run your program.
```
                           --------------
                          |  Interpeter  |
                          |    Called    |
                           --------------
                        /                   
                       /                     
    Does the program have priority keywords?  
                    /            \                         
                   /              \              
                  /                \_____________________________________________             
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------    \
       |   Parser is Called Without Lexer, then is recalled for other words  |    \
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------     /
                                              -----------                        /
                                            | Lexer Called |___________________ /
                                             --------------
                                                   |
                                                   |
                                                   |
                                                   |
                                                   |
                                              -------------- 
                                             | Parser Called |
                                              ---------------
                                                   |
                                                   |
                                                   |
                                                   |
                                                 Done!
```
This is a very basic diagram.
