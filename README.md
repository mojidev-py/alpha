# 🐺

🐺 is a funny project I am going to make that is basically python, but gen alpha-ized.

## EXAMPLE

```py

like woah is like Capping fr

wait self is rizzing up the baddies using Capping?
    rizz up "bro this is actually cool"
🐺awooo
```

## OUTPUT:
```
blud is actually coolmaxxing right now
```
as you can see, it "gen-alpha"izes the output.

## DOCUMENTATION

*Anyway, let's dive into the deep end.*

*Any keyword that requests, or asks for conditions to be satisfied, will need to have the suffix :wolf:awooo next to it, or the interpeter will raise an error.*
